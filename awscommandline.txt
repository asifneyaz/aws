Check your Python installation.

$ python --version
If your computer doesn't already have Python installed, or if you want to install a different version of Python, follow the procedure in Install the AWS CLI on Linux.

Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer

Follow these steps from the command line to install the AWS CLI using the bundled installer.

To install the AWS CLI using the bundled installer

Download the AWS CLI Bundled Installer.

$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
Unzip the package.

$ unzip awscli-bundle.zip
Note
If you don't have unzip, use your Linux distribution's built-in package manager to install it.
Run the install program.

$ sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
Note
By default, the install script runs under the system's default version of Python. If you have installed an alternative version of Python and want to use that to install the AWS CLI, run the install script and specify that version by including the absolute path to the Python application. For example:
$ sudo /usr/local/bin/python3.6 awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
This command installs the AWS CLI to /usr/local/aws and creates the symlink aws in the /usr/local/bin directory. Using the -b option to create a symlink eliminates the need to specify the install directory in the user's $PATH variable. This should enable all users to call the AWS CLI by typing aws from any directory.

To see an explanation of the -i and -b options, use the -h option.

$ ./awscli-bundle/install -h
Here are the commands summarized for easy cut and paste at the command line.

curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
Install the AWS CLI on macOS Using pip

You can also use pip directly to install the AWS CLI. If you don't have pip, follow the instructions in the main installation topic. Run pip3 --version to see if your version of macOS already includes Python and pip3.

$ pip3 --version
To install the AWS CLI on macOS

Download and install the latest version of Python from the downloads page of Python.org.

Download and run the pip3 installation script provided by the Python Packaging Authority.

$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ python3 get-pip.py --user
Use your newly installed pip3 to install the AWS CLI. We recommend that if you use Python version 3+, that you use the pip3 command.

$ pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
Verify that the AWS CLI is installed correctly.

$ aws --version
AWS CLI 1.16.116 (Python 3.6.8)
If the program isn't found, add it to your command line path.

To upgrade to the latest version, run the installation command again.

$ pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
Add the AWS CLI Executable to Your Command Line Path

After installing with pip, you might need to add the aws program to your operating system's PATH environment variable. The location of the program depends on where Python is installed.

Example AWS CLI install location - macOS with Python 3.6 and pip (user mode)

~/Library/Python/3.6/bin
Substitute the version of Python that you have for the version in the example above.

If you don't know where Python is installed, run which python.

$ which python
/usr/local/bin/python
The output might be the path to a symlink, not the actual program. Run ls -al to see where it points.

$ ls -al /usr/local/bin/python
~/Library/Python/3.7/bin/python3.6
pip installs programs in the same folder that contains the Python application. Add this folder to your PATH variable.
